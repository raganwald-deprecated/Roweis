Roweis **was** a [Sammy][s] plugin for building [Single Page Interface](http://itsnat.sourceforge.net/php/spim/spi_manifesto_en.php) applications in a highly declarative manner using convention over configuration. Roweis was developed by [Unspace Interactive][u] for a client project. Roweis as you see it here is not in use.

This repository holds a pre-release version of the code that was hosted on Github for discussion purposes. The official repository can be found at [/unspace/faux][f].
